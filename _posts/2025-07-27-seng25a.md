title: 'Causality in Flux: Continual Adaptation of Causal Knowledge via Evidence Matching'
abstract: Utilising causal knowledge in machine learning (ML) systems yields more
  robust models with the capability of performing certain extrapolations. However,
  much of current causality research focuses on deriving causal models in isolation,
  hence current systems are not capable of updating and improving causal knowledge
  when new observations arrive. Drawing inspiration from human learning, Continual
  Learning (CL) aims at updating models given a sequential stream of evidence. Leveraging
  common patterns and past experiences to gradually improve causal knowledge in ML
  models is a crucial step towards more robust CL systems. In this work, we propose
  to learn and update causal models in a lifelong learning setting where causal knowledge
  explaining newly arriving observations is inferred from similar previously seen
  observations. We call this framework evidence matching. Further, an analysis of
  real world data supporting our motivation is provided.
