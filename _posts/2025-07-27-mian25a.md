title: An Information Theoretic Framework for Continual Learning of Causal Networks.
abstract: Discovering causal networks, especially from observational data alone, is
  a fundamental yet challenging task. Existing causal discovery algorithms not only
  rely on strict assumptions such as having i.i.d data, but are also limited to working
  with static, fully-specified datasets, rendering them incapable of learning causal
  networks in a continual fashion. In this short paper, we propose an information-theoretic
  approach that can learn causal networks in a continual fashion, does not require
  the i.i.d assumption on continually arriving data, and converges to the true underlying
  causal network as samples within the accumulated batches of data converge to the
  underlying data generating distribution. Our proposed approach, ConCausD, leverages
  the Algorithmic Markov Condition to discover causal networks in an online fashion.
  ConCausD is not only capable of continual learning, it also provides multiple plausible
  causal graphs at the end of each iteration, while the existing approaches can only
  predict a single causal network.
